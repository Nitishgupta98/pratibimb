[00:00:00] Okay, I'm getting everything  ready for this lesson!
[00:00:03] Awesome!
[00:00:03] I can't wait because we get  to talk about the moon again!
[00:00:07] I know we've done that already,
[00:00:09] but that video was about the moon in general.
[00:00:12] We want to have a whole video  about the phases of the moon!
[00:00:17] The phases of the moon!
[00:00:19] Ever wonder why sometimes  the moon looks like this,
[00:00:22] and you might think, "Hey, that's  just what the moon looks like!"
[00:00:26] And other times, the moon might  look like a complete circle.
[00:00:29] What's going on?
[00:00:31] Well, the moon goes through phases.
[00:00:34] And what do the phases do?
[00:00:36] The phases change what the moon  looks like to us here on Earth!
[00:00:41] Here are the phases of the moon!
[00:00:43] If you count them, you'll see  there are eight phases of the moon!
[00:00:48] These are the phases of the moon.
[00:00:50] Notice, in one phase you  don't see the moon at all.
[00:00:53] And in another phase, you can see the entire moon!
[00:00:57] So, these eight phases have a big impact  on what the moon looks like to us!
[00:01:03] Soon, you'll know all eight of them!
[00:01:06] Alright! Let's jump right in and  learn these phases of the moon,
[00:01:10] starting with the first phase of the moon.
[00:01:12] It's called a new moon.
[00:01:15] If you're wondering where it is, join the club!
[00:01:18] It's actually right here,  where the arrow is pointing.
[00:01:20] And notice, you can't see a new moon.
[00:01:23] That's right!
[00:01:23] It looks like it just isn't there!
[00:01:27] So why can't we see a new moon?
[00:01:29] Well, during a new moon the moon is  in between the sun and the earth.
[00:01:34] Because of this, it can't reflect  the sun's light toward us.
[00:01:38] So, during a new moon, we  can't really see the moon.
[00:01:42] That's pretty interesting!
[00:01:44] Now, after a new moon the moon starts waxing.
[00:01:48] What?
[00:01:49] Yeah!
[00:01:50] Waxing!
[00:01:51] What is that supposed to mean?
[00:01:53] Well, waxing means growing.
[00:01:55] When the moon is waxing, it is getting bigger!
[00:01:58] Notice the moon begins waxing after a new  moon and grows until it becomes a full moon.
[00:02:05] Waxing means growing.
[00:02:07] After a new moon, the moon continues  waxing until it becomes a full moon.
[00:02:15] Just remember, waxing means growing!
[00:02:19] All right, we're ready for phase number two!
[00:02:23] And look at this two!
[00:02:24] So cool!
[00:02:25] So icy!
[00:02:26] So awesome!
[00:02:28] The second phase of the moon  is called a waxing crescent.
[00:02:32] A waxing crescent!
[00:02:34] That's an interesting name for this!
[00:02:36] A waxing crescent.
[00:02:38] Waxing, of course, means  that it is growing bigger.
[00:02:41] And it is called a crescent moon because  less than half of the moon looks lit.
[00:02:47] If you live in the Northern Hemisphere (the  part of the world that is north of the equator),
[00:02:53] a waxing crescent is always lit on the right side.
[00:02:58] Hey!
[00:02:58] Check this out!
[00:02:59] Here is a photo of a waxing crescent!
[00:03:02] Less than half of the moon looks lit!
[00:03:04] If you live in the Northern  Hemisphere (north of the equator),
[00:03:08] a waxing crescent is always lit on the right side.
[00:03:12] This crescent moon is waxing  because it is growing.
[00:03:16] This is the phase of the moon after a new moon.
[00:03:20] Waxing crescent!
[00:03:23] Okay! You are ready for phase number three!
[00:03:26] That's right!
[00:03:27] The third phase of the moon  is called first quarter.
[00:03:31] First quarter!
[00:03:33] Which, at first might seem a little weird!
[00:03:35] See, the moon is half-lit  with a first quarter moon.
[00:03:40] So, what's the deal?
[00:03:41] Shouldn't first quarter be called one-half moon?
[00:03:46] Well, when you have a first  quarter moon, you are one-fourth
[00:03:49] or one-quarter of the way through the lunar cycle.
[00:03:53] You can see all eight phases of the moon here.
[00:03:56] A first quarter moon tells you that you are a  quarter of the way through all eight phases.
[00:04:03] So, a first quarter moon is half-lit.
[00:04:06] And, because the moon is still waxing  (or growing) in the Northern Hemisphere,
[00:04:11] the right side is lit.
[00:04:12] Exactly one-half of a first quarter moon is lit
[00:04:16] and it is lit on the right  side because it is waxing.
[00:04:22] Alright, we are ready for the next phase!
[00:04:24] The next phase is called the waxing gibbous!
[00:04:28] Waxing gibbous!
[00:04:30] Wow!
[00:04:32] Weird name...
[00:04:33] weird name.
[00:04:35] A waxing gibbous is more than  half-lit but not quite fully lit.
[00:04:40] It is the fourth phase of the moon.
[00:04:42] A waxing gibbous is more than half-lit  and like all of the waxing moons,
[00:04:48] is lit on the right side.
[00:04:52] Here is a photograph of a waxing gibbous.
[00:04:55] Can you say that with me?
[00:04:57] Waxing gibbous!
[00:04:59] Softer.
[00:05:00] Waxing gibbous.
[00:05:02] Finally, let's say it so everyone can hear it!
[00:05:05] Waxing gibbous!
[00:05:07] Great!
[00:05:10] The cool thing about a waxing  gibbous moon is that when you see it
[00:05:13] you know a full moon is on its way!
[00:05:17] And sure enough, phase number five is....
[00:05:22] wait...Mr. Whiskers?
[00:05:23] You need to eat right now?
[00:05:25] Mr. Whiskers...this is not a convenient time!
[00:05:28] We're about to talk about  a full moon and everything!
[00:05:31] Okay!
[00:05:32] I understand!
[00:05:33] No kitty should wait!
[00:05:34] *Dry cat food sounds*
[00:05:35] All right!
[00:05:35] There you go!
[00:05:36] There you go...
[00:05:38] Now, where were we?
[00:05:38] Oh yes!
[00:05:39] Phase number five of the moon!
[00:05:42] Enjoy, Mr. Whiskers!
[00:05:44] Phase number five!
[00:05:46] The fifth phase is a full moon!
[00:05:49] It is the easiest phase to spot.
[00:05:53] A full moon is completely lit!
[00:05:55] It is a full circle.
[00:05:56] Is there anything else to say about it?
[00:05:58] It's full!
[00:05:59] It's a full moon.
[00:06:00] And once the moon is full, it is all done waxing
[00:06:04] because it can't grow anymore!
[00:06:05] It's done waxing!
[00:06:07] Which means, it will look like the  moon is getting smaller and smaller.
[00:06:12] The fancy moon word for that is waning.
[00:06:17] Waning!
[00:06:18] That's an interesting word!
[00:06:20] Waning!
[00:06:21] The moon always begins waning after a full moon,
[00:06:25] but just like waxing, waning is a process!
[00:06:29] It doesn't happen all at once.
[00:06:32] Okay, so the moon begins waning after a full moon.
[00:06:36] It starts waning (appearing  smaller and smaller) until finally,
[00:06:40] you can't even see it anymore!
[00:06:42] When you can't see the moon, remember that is  a new moon (the first phase we talked about).
[00:06:48] Waning starts with a full  moon and ends with a new moon.
[00:06:52] When the moon is waning it looks like  it is getting smaller and smaller.
[00:06:59] Now, after a full moon, we have phase number six.
[00:07:03] A waning gibbous!
[00:07:05] Wow!
[00:07:06] A waning gibbous!
[00:07:10] As you can see, a waning gibbous  is similar to a waxing gibbous.
[00:07:15] Instead of getting bigger every day,  it is waning (or getting smaller).
[00:07:20] A waning gibbous is more than half-lit,
[00:07:22] and in the Northern Hemisphere it is lit on  the left side, instead of the right side!
[00:07:29] That tells you that this is a waning gibbous.
[00:07:32] It is getting smaller and smaller.
[00:07:36] Next, we have the seventh phase of the moon!
[00:07:39] You know,
[00:07:39] the easiest way to learn the seventh phase  might be to look at it with the other phases.
[00:07:46] Here are all eight phases of the moon!
[00:07:49] The seventh phase is right here.
[00:07:51] It is called the last quarter.
[00:07:53] The last quarter means you only have  a quarter of the lunar cycle left!
[00:07:58] A quarter means one-fourth.
[00:08:00] You are in the last quarter of the lunar  cycle when you have a last quarter moon.
[00:08:06] So, that name makes sense!
[00:08:09] Just like a first quarter moon,  a last quarter moon is half-lit.
[00:08:13] But, because the moon is waning  during a last quarter moon,
[00:08:17] the moon is lit on the left side.
[00:08:20] Quarter moons are always half-lit.
[00:08:23] If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, the  last quarter is always lit on the left side.
[00:08:31] Well, the moon has been waning  (getting smaller and smaller).
[00:08:35] There's only one more phase before  we start the cycle all over again!
[00:08:41] That's right!
[00:08:41] We are on phase number eight!
[00:08:43] The last phase of the moon is a waning crescent.
[00:08:48] A waning crescent!
[00:08:52] A waning crescent is less than half-lit.
[00:08:55] All crescent moons are less than half-lit.
[00:08:57] To figure out if a crescent moon is  a waning or waxing crescent moon,
[00:09:02] just look at the side it is lit on.
[00:09:05] Waning moons are always lit on the left side,
[00:09:09] so a waning crescent is less than half-lit and is  lit on the left side (like you see right here).
[00:09:18] Those are all eight phases of the moon!
[00:09:21] Pretty cool!
[00:09:22] If you have a favorite, you won't  have to wait long before you see it,
[00:09:25] because it only takes a month for the  moon to go through all eight phases!
[00:09:32] That means all of this just takes one month!
[00:09:36] That's pretty awesome!
[00:09:37] That's pretty cool!
[00:09:39] All right, you know what?
[00:09:40] It's time for a game!
[00:09:42] We're gonna see how much we learned  about the phases of the moon!
[00:09:47] Let's call it...uh...
[00:09:49] the Faces of the Moon Game!
[00:09:51] Yeah!
[00:09:52] That's a good name for it!
[00:09:53] Are you ready to play?
[00:09:55] Okay!
[00:09:57] Ooh!
[00:09:57] Fancy music!
[00:09:58] We'll go in order, just like in nature!
[00:10:02] What is this phase called?
[00:10:05] Yes!
[00:10:06] A new moon!
[00:10:07] Fantastic!
[00:10:08] And of course, you can't see a new moon.
[00:10:10] It's like it's hiding!
[00:10:12] What is this phase called?
[00:10:17] Uh-huh!
[00:10:18] A waxing crescent!
[00:10:20] Crescent moons are less than half-lit
[00:10:22] and this moon is lit on the right side,
[00:10:26] so it must be a waxing crescent!
[00:10:29] Great job!
[00:10:30] Hmm...what is this phase called?
[00:10:33] It's half-lit.
[00:10:37] Yeah!
[00:10:38] First quarter!
[00:10:39] This is a first quarter moon!
[00:10:42] Very cool!
[00:10:45] How about this moon?
[00:10:46] What is this phase called?
[00:10:50] A waxing gibbous!
[00:10:52] A waxing gibbous!
[00:10:53] Yep!
[00:10:54] A gibbous moon is more than half-lit,
[00:10:57] but is not quite full yet!
[00:10:59] And we know it is a waxing gibbous  because it is lit on the right side!
[00:11:05] Great!
[00:11:07] What is this next phase?
[00:11:09] What is it called?
[00:11:13] You got it!
[00:11:14] A full moon!
[00:11:15] A full moon is easy to spot in the night sky!
[00:11:18] It is completely lit!
[00:11:20] A full moon!
[00:11:24] You are doing awesome!
[00:11:25] How about this next phase?
[00:11:27] What is this phase?
[00:11:31] Uh-huh!
[00:11:32] A waning gibbous!
[00:11:34] That's right!
[00:11:34] A waning gibbous!
[00:11:36] After a full moon, the moon begins  waning (or getting smaller).
[00:11:41] A waning gibbous is more than  half-lit, just like a waxing gibbous,
[00:11:47] but is lit on the left side!
[00:11:53] You are doing a tremendous job!
[00:11:55] Let's try this one!
[00:11:56] What is this phase called?
[00:11:58] Do you remember?
[00:12:01] Yeah!
[00:12:02] Last quarter!
[00:12:03] This is a last quarter moon!
[00:12:05] It is half-lit and begins the  last quarter of the lunar cycle.
[00:12:11] A last quarter moon!
[00:12:13] How about this last one?
[00:12:15] What is this phase called?
[00:12:19] Great!
[00:12:20] A waning crescent!
[00:12:22] A waning crescent!
[00:12:25] It is less than half-lit, which  is what makes it a crescent moon,
[00:12:29] and it is lit on the left side.
[00:12:32] So, it is waning!
[00:12:34] Every month the moon goes  through all of the phases!
[00:12:39] The moon goes around and  around, waxing and waning!
[00:12:43] It's pretty amazing!
[00:12:46] Well, you know all eight phases of the moon!
[00:12:49] Tell your friends!
[00:12:51] Tell a dog!
[00:12:52] Tell a cat!
[00:12:53] Tell a hamster!
[00:12:55] Whatever!
[00:12:56] Just tell someone, because it's pretty cool!
[00:13:00] It's pretty cool that you know  all eight phases of the moon!
