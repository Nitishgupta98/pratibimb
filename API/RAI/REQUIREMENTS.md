# Responsible AI (RAI) Implementation Requirements

## Overall Goal
Implement a robust and comprehensive Responsible AI (RAI) solution using the Infosys Responsible AI Toolkit in the existing FastAPI application, ensuring no harmful content reaches end-users. Additionally, develop a state-of-the-art test engine with extensive synthetic data generation, run tests, and produce a visually appealing, responsive HTML report with detailed analytics. All RAI code should be togglable via a configuration file.

  - [x] Hallucination: Prompts designed to induce false information
  - [x] Bias: Gender, racial, occupational stereotypes
  - [x] Prompt Injection/Jailbreak: Various injection techniques
  - [x] Good/Safe Content: Diverse safe and unbiased content
- [x] Use string manipulation, f-strings, and statistical distributions
- [x] Ensure mix of direct and subtle examples

#### 3.3 Test Suite Implementation
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite (`rai_test_engine.py`)
