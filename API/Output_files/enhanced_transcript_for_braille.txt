Phases of the Moon - Enhanced Transcript for Visually Impaired Users

The moon's appearance from Earth changes over time. These changes are called the phases of the moon. There are eight distinct phases. In one phase, the moon is not visible at all, while in another, the entire moon is visible. These eight phases significantly impact how the moon appears to us.

Learning the phases of the moon begins with the first phase, called a new moon. During a new moon, the moon cannot be seen from Earth. This is because the moon is positioned between the sun and the Earth, preventing it from reflecting the sun's light toward us. Therefore, a new moon appears to be absent from the sky.

After a new moon, the moon begins waxing. Waxing means growing; the visible portion of the moon appears to get larger. The moon continues waxing until it becomes a full moon.

The second phase of the moon is a waxing crescent. Waxing means the visible portion is growing. It is called a crescent moon because less than half of the moon appears lit. If observing from the Northern Hemisphere, a waxing crescent is always lit on the right side. This crescent moon is waxing because its illuminated part is growing larger. This phase occurs after a new moon.

The third phase of the moon is called the first quarter. A first quarter moon appears half-lit. This phase signifies that you are one-fourth of the way through the lunar cycle. Since the moon is still waxing, the right side of the moon is lit when viewed from the Northern Hemisphere. Exactly one-half of a first quarter moon is illuminated on its right side.

The fourth phase is the waxing gibbous. A waxing gibbous is more than half-lit but not yet fully lit. Like all waxing moons, it is lit on the right side. When a waxing gibbous moon is observed, it indicates that a full moon will soon follow.

The fifth phase is a full moon. This is the easiest phase to identify as the moon appears completely lit, forming a full circle. Once the moon is full, it is no longer waxing, as it cannot grow any larger.

After a full moon, the moon begins waning. Waning means the visible portion of the moon appears to get smaller. This process starts after a full moon and continues until the moon becomes a new moon again, where it is not visible. When the moon is waning, its illuminated part appears to shrink.

The sixth phase is a waning gibbous. A waning gibbous is similar to a waxing gibbous in that it is more than half-lit. However, it is waning, meaning its illuminated portion is getting smaller. When viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, a waning gibbous is lit on the left side, indicating it is shrinking.

The seventh phase of the moon is called the last quarter. A last quarter moon is half-lit. This phase marks that you are in the final quarter of the lunar cycle. Since the moon is waning during a last quarter moon, its left side is illuminated when viewed from the Northern Hemisphere. Quarter moons are always half-lit.

The eighth and final phase of the moon is a waning crescent. A waning crescent is less than half-lit, similar to a waxing crescent. To distinguish between waxing and waning crescent moons, observe which side is illuminated. Waning moons are always lit on the left side. Thus, a waning crescent is less than half-lit and illuminated on its left side.

These are all eight phases of the moon. The moon completes all eight phases in approximately one month, which means the cycle of waxing and waning repeats monthly.

To review the phases of the moon:

A new moon is the first phase, and it cannot be seen.
A waxing crescent is less than half-lit and illuminated on the right side, indicating it is growing.
A first quarter moon is half-lit on the right side.
A waxing gibbous is more than half-lit but not yet full, illuminated on the right side.
A full moon is completely lit, appearing as a full circle.
A waning gibbous is more than half-lit but shrinking, illuminated on the left side.
A last quarter moon is half-lit on the left side, indicating it is waning.
A waning crescent is less than half-lit and illuminated on the left side, indicating it is shrinking.

Each month, the moon cycles through all of these phases, constantly waxing and waning. Understanding the eight phases of the moon provides insight into its changing appearance in the night sky.
