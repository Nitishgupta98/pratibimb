Okay, I'm getting everything 
ready for this lesson!
Awesome!
I can't wait because we get 
to talk about the moon again!
I know we've done that already,
but that video was about the moon in general.
We want to have a whole video 
about the phases of the moon!
The phases of the moon!
Ever wonder why sometimes 
the moon looks like this,
and you might think, "Hey, that's 
just what the moon looks like!"
And other times, the moon might 
look like a complete circle.
What's going on?
Well, the moon goes through phases.
And what do the phases do?
The phases change what the moon 
looks like to us here on Earth!
Here are the phases of the moon!
If you count them, you'll see 
there are eight phases of the moon!
These are the phases of the moon.
Notice, in one phase you 
don't see the moon at all.
And in another phase, you can see the entire moon!
So, these eight phases have a big impact 
on what the moon looks like to us!
  
Soon, you'll know all eight of them!
Alright! Let's jump right in and 
learn these phases of the moon,
starting with the first phase of the moon.
It's called a new moon.
If you're wondering where it is, join the club!
It's actually right here, 
where the arrow is pointing.
And notice, you can't see a new moon.
That's right!
It looks like it just isn't there!
So why can't we see a new moon?
Well, during a new moon the moon is 
in between the sun and the earth.
Because of this, it can't reflect 
the sun's light toward us.
So, during a new moon, we 
can't really see the moon.
That's pretty interesting!
Now, after a new moon the moon starts waxing.
What?
Yeah!
Waxing!
What is that supposed to mean?
Well, waxing means growing.
When the moon is waxing, it is getting bigger!
Notice the moon begins waxing after a new 
moon and grows until it becomes a full moon.
Waxing means growing.
After a new moon, the moon continues 
waxing until it becomes a full moon.
Just remember, waxing means growing!
All right, we're ready for phase number two!
And look at this two!
So cool!
So icy!
So awesome!
The second phase of the moon 
is called a waxing crescent.
A waxing crescent!
That's an interesting name for this!
A waxing crescent.
Waxing, of course, means 
that it is growing bigger.
And it is called a crescent moon because 
less than half of the moon looks lit.
If you live in the Northern Hemisphere (the 
part of the world that is north of the equator),
a waxing crescent is always lit on the right side.
Hey!
Check this out!
Here is a photo of a waxing crescent!
Less than half of the moon looks lit!
If you live in the Northern 
Hemisphere (north of the equator),  
a waxing crescent is always lit on the right side.
This crescent moon is waxing 
because it is growing.
This is the phase of the moon after a new moon.
Waxing crescent!
Okay! You are ready for phase number three!
That's right!
The third phase of the moon 
is called first quarter.
First quarter!
Which, at first might seem a little weird!
See, the moon is half-lit 
with a first quarter moon.
So, what's the deal?
Shouldn't first quarter be called one-half moon?
Well, when you have a first 
quarter moon, you are one-fourth  
or one-quarter of the way through the lunar cycle.
You can see all eight phases of the moon here.
A first quarter moon tells you that you are a 
quarter of the way through all eight phases.
So, a first quarter moon is half-lit.
And, because the moon is still waxing 
(or growing) in the Northern Hemisphere,
the right side is lit.
Exactly one-half of a first quarter moon is lit  
and it is lit on the right 
side because it is waxing.
Alright, we are ready for the next phase!
The next phase is called the waxing gibbous!
Waxing gibbous!
Wow!
Weird name...
weird name.
A waxing gibbous is more than 
half-lit but not quite fully lit.
It is the fourth phase of the moon.
A waxing gibbous is more than half-lit 
and like all of the waxing moons,
is lit on the right side.
Here is a photograph of a waxing gibbous.
Can you say that with me?
Waxing gibbous!
Softer.
Waxing gibbous.
Finally, let's say it so everyone can hear it!
Waxing gibbous!
Great!
The cool thing about a waxing 
gibbous moon is that when you see it  
you know a full moon is on its way!
And sure enough, phase number five is....
wait...Mr. Whiskers?
You need to eat right now?
Mr. Whiskers...this is not a convenient time!
We're about to talk about 
a full moon and everything!
Okay!
I understand!
No kitty should wait!
*Dry cat food sounds*
All right!
There you go!
There you go...
Now, where were we?
Oh yes!
Phase number five of the moon!
Enjoy, Mr. Whiskers!
Phase number five!
The fifth phase is a full moon!
It is the easiest phase to spot.
A full moon is completely lit!
It is a full circle.
Is there anything else to say about it?
It's full!
It's a full moon.
And once the moon is full, it is all done waxing
because it can't grow anymore!
It's done waxing!
Which means, it will look like the 
moon is getting smaller and smaller.
The fancy moon word for that is waning.
Waning!
That's an interesting word!
Waning!
The moon always begins waning after a full moon,
but just like waxing, waning is a process!
It doesn't happen all at once.
Okay, so the moon begins waning after a full moon.
It starts waning (appearing 
smaller and smaller) until finally,
you can't even see it anymore!
When you can't see the moon, remember that is 
a new moon (the first phase we talked about).
Waning starts with a full 
moon and ends with a new moon.
When the moon is waning it looks like 
it is getting smaller and smaller.
Now, after a full moon, we have phase number six.
A waning gibbous!
Wow!
A waning gibbous!
As you can see, a waning gibbous 
is similar to a waxing gibbous.
Instead of getting bigger every day, 
it is waning (or getting smaller).
A waning gibbous is more than half-lit,
and in the Northern Hemisphere it is lit on 
the left side, instead of the right side!
That tells you that this is a waning gibbous.
It is getting smaller and smaller.
Next, we have the seventh phase of the moon!
You know,  
the easiest way to learn the seventh phase 
might be to look at it with the other phases.
Here are all eight phases of the moon!
The seventh phase is right here.
It is called the last quarter.
The last quarter means you only have 
a quarter of the lunar cycle left!
A quarter means one-fourth.
You are in the last quarter of the lunar 
cycle when you have a last quarter moon.
So, that name makes sense!
Just like a first quarter moon, 
a last quarter moon is half-lit.
But, because the moon is waning 
during a last quarter moon,
the moon is lit on the left side.
Quarter moons are always half-lit.
If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, the 
last quarter is always lit on the left side.
Well, the moon has been waning 
(getting smaller and smaller).
There's only one more phase before 
we start the cycle all over again!
That's right!
We are on phase number eight!
The last phase of the moon is a waning crescent.
A waning crescent!
A waning crescent is less than half-lit.
All crescent moons are less than half-lit.
To figure out if a crescent moon is 
a waning or waxing crescent moon,
just look at the side it is lit on.
Waning moons are always lit on the left side,
so a waning crescent is less than half-lit and is 
lit on the left side (like you see right here).
Those are all eight phases of the moon!
Pretty cool!
If you have a favorite, you won't 
have to wait long before you see it,
because it only takes a month for the 
moon to go through all eight phases!
That means all of this just takes one month!
That's pretty awesome!
That's pretty cool!
All right, you know what?
It's time for a game!
We're gonna see how much we learned 
about the phases of the moon!
Let's call it...uh...
the Faces of the Moon Game!
Yeah!
That's a good name for it!
Are you ready to play?
Okay!
Ooh!
Fancy music!
We'll go in order, just like in nature!
What is this phase called?
Yes!
A new moon!
Fantastic!
And of course, you can't see a new moon.
It's like it's hiding!
What is this phase called?
Uh-huh!
A waxing crescent!
Crescent moons are less than half-lit
and this moon is lit on the right side,
so it must be a waxing crescent!
Great job!
Hmm...what is this phase called?
It's half-lit.
Yeah!
First quarter!
This is a first quarter moon!
Very cool!
How about this moon?
What is this phase called?
A waxing gibbous!
A waxing gibbous!
Yep!
A gibbous moon is more than half-lit,
but is not quite full yet!
And we know it is a waxing gibbous 
because it is lit on the right side!
Great!
What is this next phase?
What is it called?
You got it!
A full moon!
A full moon is easy to spot in the night sky!
It is completely lit!
A full moon!
You are doing awesome!
How about this next phase?
What is this phase?
Uh-huh!
A waning gibbous!
That's right!
A waning gibbous!
After a full moon, the moon begins 
waning (or getting smaller).
A waning gibbous is more than 
half-lit, just like a waxing gibbous,
but is lit on the left side!
You are doing a tremendous job!
Let's try this one!
What is this phase called?
Do you remember?
Yeah!
Last quarter!
This is a last quarter moon!
It is half-lit and begins the 
last quarter of the lunar cycle.
A last quarter moon!
How about this last one?
What is this phase called?
Great!
A waning crescent!
A waning crescent!
It is less than half-lit, which 
is what makes it a crescent moon,
and it is lit on the left side.
So, it is waning!
Every month the moon goes 
through all of the phases!
The moon goes around and 
around, waxing and waning!
It's pretty amazing!
Well, you know all eight phases of the moon!
Tell your friends!
Tell a dog!
Tell a cat!
Tell a hamster!
Whatever!
Just tell someone, because it's pretty cool!
It's pretty cool that you know 
all eight phases of the moon!
