Phases of the Moon - Enhanced Transcript for Visually Impaired Users

The phases of the moon will be discussed.

The moon goes through different appearances. Sometimes it appears as a thin curve, and at other times, it looks like a complete circle. These changes in appearance are known as the phases of the moon.

The phases of the moon alter its appearance from Earth. There are eight distinct phases. In one phase, the moon is not visible, while in another, the entire moon is seen. These eight phases significantly influence how the moon appears. The eight phases will be explained.

The first phase of the moon is called a new moon. During a new moon, the moon is positioned between the sun and the Earth. Consequently, it cannot reflect the sun's light towards Earth, making it invisible to observers.

After a new moon, the moon begins to wax. Waxing means that the illuminated portion of the moon, as seen from Earth, is growing larger. The moon continues to wax, or grow in apparent size, until it reaches the full moon phase.

The second phase of the moon is a waxing crescent. "Waxing" indicates that the illuminated part is growing. "Crescent" signifies that less than half of the moon appears lit. For observers in the Northern Hemisphere, a waxing crescent is always illuminated on its right side. This phase occurs after the new moon.

The third phase of the moon is the first quarter. Although it is called a "quarter," the moon appears half-lit during this phase. This name indicates that the moon has completed one-fourth of its entire lunar cycle through all eight phases. Since the moon is still waxing, or appearing to grow, the right half of the moon is illuminated for observers in the Northern Hemisphere.

The fourth phase of the moon is a waxing gibbous. A waxing gibbous moon appears more than half-lit but is not yet fully illuminated. As with all waxing phases, the right side of the moon is lit. When this phase is observed, it indicates that a full moon will soon appear.

The fifth phase of the moon is a full moon. This phase is easily recognizable as the entire moon appears completely illuminated, forming a full circle. Once the moon is full, it has completed its waxing period, as it cannot grow larger in apparent size.

After the full moon, the illuminated portion of the moon begins to decrease in size, a process known as waning. Waning means that the moon appears to be getting smaller. This process starts after a full moon and continues until the moon becomes a new moon, where it is no longer visible.

The sixth phase is a waning gibbous. Similar to a waxing gibbous, a waning gibbous moon appears more than half-lit. However, because it is waning, or appearing to get smaller, the left side of the moon is illuminated for observers in the Northern Hemisphere.

The seventh phase of the moon is the last quarter. This phase signifies that only one-fourth of the lunar cycle remains. Like the first quarter moon, a last quarter moon appears half-lit. However, because the moon is waning during this phase, the left side of the moon is illuminated for Northern Hemisphere observers.

The eighth and final phase before the cycle repeats is a waning crescent. A waning crescent moon appears less than half-lit. Since all waning moons are illuminated on the left side, a waning crescent is distinguished by its less-than-half illumination on the left.

The moon completes all eight phases in approximately one month.

Here is a review of the moon phases in their natural order.

The first phase is a new moon. This phase is not visible.

The next phase is a waxing crescent. This crescent moon is less than half-lit and illuminated on the right side, indicating it is waxing.

The next phase is a first quarter moon. This phase is half-lit.

The next phase is a waxing gibbous. A gibbous moon is more than half-lit but not yet full. It is a waxing gibbous because it is lit on the right side.

The next phase is a full moon. A full moon is completely illuminated and easily visible.

The next phase is a waning gibbous. After a full moon, the moon begins waning, appearing to get smaller. A waning gibbous is more than half-lit, but unlike a waxing gibbous, it is illuminated on the left side.

The next phase is a last quarter moon. This phase is half-lit and marks the start of the last quarter of the lunar cycle.

The final phase is a waning crescent. This crescent moon is less than half-lit and is illuminated on the left side, indicating it is waning.

The moon cycles through all eight phases each month, continuously waxing and waning. Understanding the eight phases of the moon is a valuable insight. Information about supporting educational content is available at HomeschoolPop.com. Thank you for learning about the phases of the moon.
