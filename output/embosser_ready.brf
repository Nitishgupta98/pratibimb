 understanding the  moon's  changing    
 looks                                  
 have you ever thought about how the    
 moon appears to change in the night    
sky?  sometimes it feels like a tiny    
sliver, other times it feels like a big,
bright circle!  these changes are not   
because the  moon is actually changing  
its shape, but because of how much of   
its surface is lit up by the  sun as the
 moon travels around the  earth.  these 
different appearances are called lunar  
phases, and there are eight of them.    
 the  moon goes through all these phases
in about a month!                       
                                        
 the  moon's  eight  appearances        
 let's explore the different ways the   
 moon appears to us:                    
                                        
 new  moon:  imagine the  moon is like a
quiet friend.  during a new moon, it's  
positioned between the  sun and  earth, 
so the side facing us isn't lit up at   
                                      #a

all.  we can't sense it in the sky!     
                                        
 getting  brighter:  waxing!            
 after the new moon, a little bit of the
 moon starts to get light, and it gets  
brighter each night.  this is called    
waxing.  think of it like something     
slowly growing bigger and brighter.     
                                        
 waxing  crescent:  this is when we can 
notice just a tiny, bright curve of the 
 moon.  less than half of the  moon is  
lit.  since it's waxing, this bright    
curve is on the right side of the  moon.
                                        
 first  quarter:  now, half of the  moon
feels bright!  even though it's called  
 ?first quarter, ? it means the  moon   
has finished one-fourth of its trip     
around  earth.  the right half is       
bright.                                 
                                        
 waxing  gibbous:  the  moon is getting 
even brighter now!  more than half of it
                                      #b

is lit, but it's not a full circle yet. 
 the bright part is still on the right  
side because it's waxing.               
                                        
 the  big  bright  moon                 
 full  moon:  wow!  this is when the    
entire  moon feels completely bright,   
like a large, glowing circle.  it's     
often easy to notice and feels so       
bright!  the  earth is right between the
 sun and the  moon, so we experience the
 moon's fully lit side.  after this, the
 moon starts to appear  ?smaller ?      
again.                                  
                                        
 getting  smaller:  waning!             
 once the  moon is full, the bright part
starts to get smaller and smaller each  
night.  this is called waning.  imagine 
something slowly diminishing in size.   
                                        
 waning  gibbous:  just like the waxing 
gibbous, more than half of the  moon is 
still lit, but now the bright area is   
                                      #c

getting smaller.  the lit part is on the
left side.                              
                                        
 last  quarter:  again, half of the     
 moon is lit, but now it's the left     
half.  this means the  moon has         
completed three-fourths of its journey  
around  earth.                          
                                        
 waning  crescent:  this is the last    
tiny sliver we sense before the  moon   
seems to disappear again for the new    
moon.  it's a thin curve, but this time 
it's on the left side, showing it's     
still waning.                           
                                        
 the  moon's  continuous  dance         
 the  moon keeps going around and around
the  earth, changing how it appears from
brighter   waxing   to dimmer           
  waning  , over and over again.  it's  
like a never-ending cycle in the sky!   
 now you know all eight of the  moon's  
amazing phases!  isn't that cool?
