An Explanation of the Eight Phases of the Moon

The appearance of the moon changes throughout the month because it goes through different phases. [Fig_1: Telescope] These phases change what the moon looks like to us here on Earth. There are a total of eight phases in the moon's cycle. [Fig_2: Lunar Cycle Diagram] In one phase, the moon is not visible at all, and in another, it appears as a complete circle.

The cycle begins with the first phase, called a new moon. [Fig_3: New Moon] During a new moon, you cannot see the moon in the sky. This happens because the moon is positioned between the sun and the Earth, which prevents the sun's light from reflecting off the moon's surface toward us. [Fig_4: Sun-Moon-Earth Alignment]

After a new moon, the moon starts waxing. [Fig_5: Waxing Process Diagram] The word waxing means growing, so the visible portion of the moon gets bigger each night. This process continues until the moon becomes full.

The second phase is the waxing crescent. [Fig_6: Waxing Crescent Moon] During this phase, less than half of the moon is lit. For observers in the Northern Hemisphere, a waxing crescent is always lit on the right side.

The third phase is called the first quarter. [Fig_7: First Quarter Moon] This name can seem confusing because the moon appears half-lit. It is called the first quarter because at this point, the moon is one-quarter of the way through its full cycle of eight phases. Since the moon is still waxing, the lit portion is on the right side.

Next is the fourth phase, the waxing gibbous. [Fig_8: Waxing Gibbous Moon] A gibbous moon is one that is more than half-lit but not yet completely full. As with all waxing phases, it is lit on the right side.

The fifth phase is the full moon. [Fig_9: Full Moon] This is the easiest phase to recognize because the moon is completely lit and appears as a perfect circle. Once the moon is full, it has finished waxing because it cannot appear any larger.

After a full moon, the moon begins waning, which means it appears to get smaller each night. [Fig_10: Waning Process Diagram] The waning process continues until the moon becomes a new moon again, starting the cycle over.

The sixth phase is the waning gibbous. [Fig_11: Waning Gibbous Moon] Similar to a waxing gibbous, it is more than half-lit. However, because it is waning, or getting smaller, the lit portion is on the left side for observers in the Northern Hemisphere.

The seventh phase is the last quarter. [Fig_12: Last Quarter Moon] Just like the first quarter, the moon is half-lit. This phase is called the last quarter because there is only one-fourth of the lunar cycle left. Since the moon is waning, the left side is lit.

The eighth and final phase is the waning crescent. [Fig_13: Waning Crescent Moon] In this phase, less than half of the moon is lit. To know it is a waning crescent, you can observe that the light is on the left side.

This entire cycle of eight phases, from one new moon to the next, takes about one month to complete.
