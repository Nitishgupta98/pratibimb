The Eight Phases of the Moon

The appearance of the moon changes from our perspective on Earth. [Fig_1: Telescope] These changes are called phases. The moon goes through eight distinct phases in a repeating cycle. [Fig_2: The 8 Phases of the Moon (Linear Diagram)]

The first phase is called the new moon. [Fig_3: New Moon] During this phase, the moon cannot be seen from Earth. This is because the moon is positioned between the sun and the Earth, so it cannot reflect the sun's light toward us. [Fig_4: Sun-Moon-Earth Alignment]

After a new moon, the moon begins to "wax," which means it appears to grow larger in the sky. This process of waxing continues until it becomes a full moon.

The second phase is the waxing crescent. [Fig_5: Waxing Crescent] A crescent moon is when less than half of the moon is lit. During the waxing crescent phase, the lit portion is on the right side for observers in the Northern Hemisphere.

The third phase is the first quarter. [Fig_6: First Quarter] In this phase, exactly half of the moon is lit up. It is called the first quarter because it marks the point when the moon is one-quarter of the way through its full cycle of phases. Because it is still waxing, the right side of the moon is lit.

Next is the fourth phase, the waxing gibbous. [Fig_7: Waxing Gibbous] A gibbous moon is when more than half of the moon is lit, but it is not yet completely full. As a waxing moon, its right side is illuminated. Seeing a waxing gibbous moon means a full moon is coming soon.

The fifth phase is the full moon. [Fig_8: Full Moon] This is the easiest phase to recognize, as the entire moon is lit up, appearing as a complete circle. After the full moon, it cannot grow any larger, so the waxing process is complete.

Following the full moon, the moon begins to "wane," which means it appears to get smaller. The waning process continues until the moon becomes a new moon again, starting the cycle over.

The sixth phase is the waning gibbous. [Fig_9: Waning Gibbous] Similar to a waxing gibbous, it is more than half-lit. However, because it is waning, the lit portion appears on the left side for observers in the Northern Hemisphere.

The seventh phase is the last quarter. [Fig_10: Last Quarter] Just like a first quarter moon, the last quarter is exactly half-lit. This phase signifies that the moon is in the final quarter of its cycle. Because the moon is waning, the left side is lit.

The eighth and final phase is the waning crescent. [Fig_11: Waning Crescent] Less than half of the moon is lit during this phase. Since it is waning, the lit sliver is on the left side.

This entire cycle of eight phases, from one new moon to the next, takes about one month to complete. [Fig_12: The Full Lunar Cycle (Circular Diagram)]
